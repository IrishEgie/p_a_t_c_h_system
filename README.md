The PATCH System is your AI-driven road safety partner. It detects potholes, provides real-time alerts, and empowers users to report and update road conditions for safer highways.     This system is designed &amp; collaborated by BSCPE Students of Samar State University as a partial requirement in the completion of their capstone work.
